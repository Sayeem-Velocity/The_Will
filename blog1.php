        <h2>When Eid brings joy...</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">"No shadows to depress you,only joys to sorround you,Allah HIMSELF to bless you,today,tomorrow & everyday."
        </p>
        <p>That day I realized the real joy of sharing. Those tired eyes, long glazed sight, pleaded hands,faded smile said it all,
        </p>
        <p>that time I realized 'You can't measure what you shared,because it's more of feelings,feelings of love & kindness.'They got goods & I got satisfaction, both slept in peace.</p>

        <h2>Tree,tree,save our planet!</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">"Plant a tree and see it grow;
            so you can enjoy the cool breeze flow."
        </p>
        <p>In present time,where cutting trees to urbanize this globe has become a prequisite factor,we embeded our future,as it says "He who plants a tree plants a hope"
        </p>
        <p>It was an outstading experience of authoriative action,teamwork, and field work.
            Our desrire,dedication & sweat added a significant shade to this "Green Heaven"

        <h2>Blanket of 'Warmth'</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">"One kind word can warm three winter months"
        </p>
        <p>It was different than other mornings,for us where winter morning is much cherishable & comfortable,there were people out there having no space and home,let alone comforts and necessities. 
        </p>
        <p>We blended ourselves in their miseries,explored this world with their eyes.
            After providing quilts,We atlast came back with a sweet smile of satisfaction.  </p>
